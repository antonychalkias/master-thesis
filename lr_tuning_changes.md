# Learning Rate Tuning Strategies - Implementation Details

This document summarizes the learning rate tuning strategies implemented for the food recognition and weight estimation model.

## 1. Overview of Changes

We have implemented several learning rate tuning strategies to improve model training:

1. **Reduced Default Learning Rate**: Changed the default learning rate from 1e-4 to 5e-5 for better stability
2. **Learning Rate Finder**: Added a tool to automatically find the optimal learning rate 
3. **One Cycle Learning Rate**: Implemented this cyclical learning rate strategy for better convergence
4. **Cosine Annealing**: Added gradual decay using cosine annealing
5. **More Gradual Step LR**: Modified the step scheduler to be more gradual (step_size=5, gamma=0.75)

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Learning Rate Finder (`lr_finder.py`)

The Learning Rate Finder implements the technique described in Leslie Smith's paper "Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks." It works by:

- Training the model with exponentially increasing learning rates
- Tracking the loss at each step
- Analyzing the loss curve to find the optimal learning rate
- Automatically recommending the best learning rate value

### 2.2 One Cycle Learning Rate (`one_cycle_lr.py`)

The One Cycle Learning Rate scheduler:

- Increases the learning rate from a small value to a maximum value
- Then decreases it back down using cosine annealing
- Simultaneously adjusts momentum in the opposite direction
- Provides better convergence in fewer epochs

### 2.3 Modified Training Script (`train.py`)

The main training script was modified to:

- Support multiple learning rate strategies (one_cycle, cosine, step, find)
- Track and log learning rates across epochs
- Visualize learning rate schedules
- Change default learning rate from 1e-4 to 5e-5

### 2.4 Visualizations and Comparisons

Added scripts to:
- Visualize training metrics with learning rate analysis (`visualize_training_advanced.py`)
- Compare different learning rate strategies (`compare_lr_strategies.py`)

## 3. Performance Results

Initial tests showed promising results:

- **One Cycle LR**: Best overall performance with rapid improvement in both accuracy and weight MAE
- **Step LR**: Consistent but slower improvement
- **Cosine Annealing**: Showed potential but needed longer training runs

For quick tests (3 epochs), the One Cycle LR strategy reduced weight MAE from ~80g to ~23g and improved accuracy significantly.

## 4. File Changes

- Created `lr_finder.py`: Learning rate finder implementation
- Created `one_cycle_lr.py`: Custom One Cycle LR scheduler
- Modified `train.py`: Added support for multiple learning rate strategies
- Created `visualize_training_advanced.py`: Advanced training metrics visualization
- Created `compare_lr_strategies.py`: Tool to compare different strategies

## 5. Next Steps

- Run longer training sessions (20+ epochs) to fully evaluate the benefits
- Fine-tune the parameters of each learning rate strategy
- Combine these strategies with regularization techniques
